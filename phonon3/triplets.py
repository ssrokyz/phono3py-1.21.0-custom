        Rotation matrices in real space. Note that those in reciprocal space

        Inversion symemtry is added if it doesn't exist. Default is True.

    -------
    triplets_at_q : ndarray
        Symmetry reduced number of triplets are stored as grid point
        integer numbers.

        Integer grid address of the points in Brillouin zone including
